# tools-neuron-morphology

This repository contains Perl code for tools to retrieve and process neuronal data from Neuromorpho.Org.

The code is reported in a manuscript that is currently in review at a journal.

The code was tested in Strawberry Perl and is expected to run in Perl version 5.8.1 or higher, a language available for nearly any commonly used operating system.

Strawberry Perl includes the LWP or JSON modules, but if they are missing in your Perl distribution, then please follow the instructions of your distribution for installing additional modules. Typically, the CPAN package manager supports installation of the missing Perl modules.
